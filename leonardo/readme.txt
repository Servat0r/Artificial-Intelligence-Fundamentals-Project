To define an experiment add a new entry in the json file with the proper Hyperparameters. The entry should have the name <experiment-name>.

To run the experiment:
    python bw-reconstruct.py <experiment-name>
where <experiment-name> is the name of the experiment to run with the Hyperparameters defined in the json file.
